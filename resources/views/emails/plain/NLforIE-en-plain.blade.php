Dear {{$user->first_name}} {{$user->last_name}},

We would like to respond to some feedback on the booking process for the Mother Divine Program that we received from participants of the Guru Purnima 2011 program - Immortal Enlightenment (IE).

During the booking process for the new website (www.srikaleshwar.world), an extra payment option for IE students could not be developed at such short notice before the program. For this purpose, the additional comment field (Message about your booking) should offer the opportunity to provide information about the booking. Some IE students have taken advantage of this option and announced that they were IE participants and would like to transfer a lower amount. From the feedback weâ€™ve received, we could see that this possibility was not sufficiently clear. Therefore we have worked full speed on the completion of an individual payment option and are pleased that IE students are now able to freely choose the amount.


Regarding the amount of the program contribution for IE students:

In the previous programs at the ashram, there was a reduced fee for IE students, where only a contribution to expenses for food and operating costs was charged. With an online program, one could assume that such expenses will not arise because one is not there. In reality, however, the Ashram continues to incur high operating costs, even if none of us is on site.

Due to the special worldwide situation it was not possible for anyone to visit the Ashram in the last 6 months and therefore important income has been lost. The investment in the new solar system for a sustainable infrastructure in the ashram, which was initiated before the Corona period, also increased the overall expenditure due to the installation effort.

At the regular price for the online program, the challenging financial situation among the students caused by the Corona virus was addressed and a moderate contribution was set. We hope that as many students as possible will see this contribution not only as a program fee, but rather as a support for the Ashram and our soul home.

Due to the situation described, we would like to give all IE students an option to decide how much can be added to the expenses or whether the regular price is paid as support. Simply enter your contribution in the new input field in the booking form and after booking you can pay this amount directly via PayPal or bank transfer.

We are sincerely grateful for any support.

If you have already paid the entire program amount because you did not notice the notification option described above and you are uncomfortable with the amount, please write the student office the desired amount and we will arrange for the repayment.

Many blessings to you,
    Shilpa, Penukonda core team, Ashram family
