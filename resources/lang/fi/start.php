            In the first stage we would like to offer all certified teachings to update the teacher profile themselves, which appears on the homepage of the Ashram.
            Here the contact details, a detailed description about you and your work and also the topics that you teach and offer can be edited. You can also decide for yourself whether the profile is visible on the homepage.
            You can find detailed instructions for editing the teacher profile via the following link:

        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as you have made your profile visible, you can see it in the list on the website of the Ashram. You can use the following link:
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.srikaleshwar.world/en/events/teachers-groups" target="_blank">https://www.srikaleshwar.world/en/events/teachers-groups</a>

            If you have any questions, just contact the technical team:<br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Email:</td><td class="px-3"><a href="mailto:admin@srikaleshwar.world">admin@srikaleshwar.world</a></td>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
        <p>
            Further expansion stages of the ashram portal for teachers are planned in the future.
            In the next step you will be able to set up your own events and seminars, which will then be published on the homepage of the Ashram.
            It is also planned that you will also be able to manage bookings of your participants via the portal and thus use many useful functions of the portal.
        </p>
        <p>
            We always look forward to feedback if you have suggestions for improvements.
        </p>
        <p>Best regards from your technical team</p>'
